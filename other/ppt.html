                            Bluetooth module has two modes one is master mode and second one is slave mode. User can set
                            either mode by using some AT commands. Even user can set module’s setting by using AT
                            command. Here is some commands uses are given:<br><br>
                            Press Forword button: Car moves forward. ( all wheels start moving forward ) <br><br>
                            Press Back button: Car moves in reverse. ( all wheels start moving backward ) <br><br>
                            Press Left button: Car turns to left side. ( Only right wheels move forword left move
                            reverse) <br><br>
                            Press Right button: Car turns to right side. ( Only left wheels move forward right move
                            reverse)<br><br>
                            When all buttons press then car will going to line following. this button sending data to
                            blutooth module
                            and this module send to Arduino Board then board take action accordng from user <br>

                            The concept of working of line follower is related to light. We use here the behavior of
                            light at the black and white surfaces. When light falls on a white surface it is almost
                            fully reflected and in the case of a black surface light is completely absorbed. This
                            behavior of light is used in building a line follower robot. <br>

                            <span>* Arduino Board </span> <br>
                            The Arduino software is used to build the code for every project made using any Arduino
                            boards; it mostly uses the C/C++ language for its coding. Once the code is ready, we have to
                            just compile and upload it on the board to make our project work. There are many types of
                            Arduino boards like Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano, Arduino USB, etc. In this project, we are
                            going to use the Arduino UNO board (Atmega 328p). <br><br>

                            <span>* Bluetooth Module </span> <br>
                            HC Bluetooth module consists two things one is Bluetooth serial interface module and a
                            Bluetooth adaptor. Bluetooth serial module is used for converting serial port to Bluetooth.
                            <br><br>

                            <span>* Gear Motor </span> <br>
                            We have used two geared motors at the rear of the line follower robot. These motors provide
                            more torque than normal motors and can be used for carrying some load as well. <br><br>

                            <span>* Motor Driver </span> <br>
                            The L298N Motor Driver Module is responsible for providing the necessary drive current to
                            the motors of the robotic car. I have provided information about L298N Module in an earlier
                            project called Arduino DC Motor Control using L298N. <br><br>

                            <span>* Motor Wheels </span> <br>
                            wheels used for car moving and simply its work. <br><br>

                            <span>* Jumper Wires </span> <br>
                            Jumper wires are simply wires that have connector pins at each end, allowing them to be used
                            to connect two points to each other without soldering. Jumper wires are typically used with
                            breadboards and other prototyping tools in order to make it easy to change a circuit as
                            needed. Fairly simple. In fact, it doesn’t get much more basic than jumper wires.
                            It is 3 type male to male, female to female, female to male<br><br>

                            <span>* Battery </span> <br>
                            Battery is one of the most important thing in this project ! It's use for current in circuit
                            I use 3.7v battery 4pcs when these are connected to serise conection then its work base on
                            14.8v and
                            this power user in motor driver and arduino.
                            <br><br>

                            <span>* LED </span> <br>
                            In this project led used for light as front light, back light, left light etc. <br><br>

                            <span>* IR Sensor </span> <br>
                            It's used for line follower black object detection. Its's not working black surface and sun
                            light <br><br>

                            <span>* Touch Sensor </span> <br>
                            It's used for light connection toggle on and off in arduino. <br><br>

                            <span>* LDR Sensor </span> <br>
                            It's used for known brightness like day or night. <br><br>

                            <span>* PIR Sensor </span> <br>
                            PIR sensors are most commonly used in motion-based detection, such as in-home security
                            systems. When a moving object that generates infrared radiation enters the sensing range of
                            the detector, the difference in IR levels between the two pyroelectric elements is measured.
                            The sensor then sends an electronic signal to an embedded computer, which in turn triggers
                            an alarm. <br><br>

                            <span>* Switch Sensor </span> <br>
                            It's used for light connection toggle on and off in main circuit. <br><br>

                            <span>* Simple Wires </span> <br>
                            Simple Wires are used to bear mechanical loads or electricity and telecommunications
                            signals and connectoins for motor and battery etc.<br><br>

                            <span>* Electrical instruments</span> <br>
                            Electrical instruments are instruments that use the mechanical movement of electromagnetic
                            meter to measure voltage, power, current… Electrical technicians require electrical
                            measurement equipment to check the electrical activity and to detect the presence of voltage
                            or current. By using this instrument we can measure electrical parameters such as voltage,
                            frequency, current, power factor, and resistance. Electrical measurements are depended upon
                            either current or voltage while measuring the frequency we will be measuring the frequency
                            of a current signal or a voltage signal.<br><br>

                            <span>* Bluetooth Controller App</span> <br>
                            After installing app you need to open it and then search Bluetooth device and select desired
                            Bluetooth device. And then configure keys. Here in this project we have used Bluetooth
                            controller app.<br><br>

                            <span>* Android device</span> <br>

                            <span>* Arduino IDE</span> <br>
                            The open-source Arduino Software (IDE) makes it easy to write code and upload it to the
                            board. This software can be used with any Arduino board. <br><br>

                            First install the Arduino software. Installation instructions are very simple, you should
                            not have any trouble with this step. <br>
                            The code at the master device, or the joystick is quite simple. We just need to read the X
                            and Y values of the joystick, which actually regulate the speed of the motors, and send them
                            via the serial port to the slave HC-05 Bluetooth device. We can note here that the analog
                            values of joystick from 0 to 1023 are converted into a values from 0 to 255 by diving them
                            by 4.<br><br>
